1) run the test molecules using a large reference basis set.
2) run opt-dzvp.inp to optimize all parameters (exponents and coefficients)
3) run opt-all.inp based on the DZVP basis to get TZVP/TZV2P basis sets

IMPORTANT: Hybrid functionals cannot be used for optimization of basis.
           Run the test molecules using the hybrid functionals.
           Then run the optimization running a GGA (it is not used).
